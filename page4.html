        <br>

        <p>Hello Dear Family and Friends,</p>
      
        <p>Happy Father's Day to all Dads everywhere. * \"A good father is one of the most unsung, unpraised, unnoticed, and yet one of the most valuable assets in our society.\" - Billy Graham *We love you all.</p>
        
        <p>This week we wrapped up a wonderful visit with <person>David</person>'s Family. After church, some of the boys gave us a personal piano recital. Then we went to our apartment and fixed a typical <person>Barker</person> Sunday Dinner... Waffles and Scrambled eggs. I am not wasting any time using my waffle iron :) Our apartment was almost big enough. My favorite part was that <person>David</person> made the scrambled eggs, his Dad made the waffles, and one of the boys said that was his favorite meal of the trip. I think he was trying to make us feel good.</p>
        
        <p>We then went to the <place>La Recoleta Cemetery</place> in <place>Buenos Aires</place>. It is very massive, with over 6,000 statues, coffins and crypts that commemorate some of <place>Argentina</place>'s most notable people.</p>
    
        <p>Monday, <person>Elder Barker</person> and I spent time in the office. Then we went out to dinner with the family to *Siga La Vaca*. This is our second time and it doesn't disappoint. When we got back to their AIRBNB, we played a great game of Bank.</p>
        
        <p>Tuesday morning we loaded all of the familyâ€™s luggage in the back of the truck. Some rode with us and others went in an Uber. We made our way to <place>China Town</place> and walked around for a while. I think one of the best buys was \"knock off\" Pokeman cards. Then it was time to head to the airport to say goodbye. We had such a wonderful visit and there were a few tears as we said goodbye.</p>
        
        <p>The rest of the week was back to â€œnormalâ€ at the office:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>The rain came tumbling down and the mission office flooded.</li>
        <li>Keys were lost, Pensions were fixed, and bills were paid.</li>
        <li>We said goodbye to awesome <person>Elder Fackrell</person>, <person>Elder Eubanks</person>, and others going home after serving the Lord.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>While we were out doing our Saturday errands, we got a call from our son, <person>John</person>. He was having a package delivered to the mission office for <person>Elder Barker</person> for Fatherâ€™s Day. And, by the way, it needs to be refrigerated. Again, <person>Elder Ford</person> and <person>Elder Villatorro</person> stepped in and saved the day. Thank you again.</p>
        
        <p>End of Travel Logâ€¦ till next week.</p>
        
        <p>Have a great week. We love you all,</p>
        
        <p><person>Elder</person> and <person>Sister Barker</person></p>
